# Analysis
## Overview

Data has been provided for around 80 thousand loans that have been labeled as healthy or high-risk.  I was tasked with creating a machine learning model that can accurately predict the status of a loan, given various features such as loan size, income, total debt, et cetera.  I started by spliting the data into training and testing groups.  The training group was used to create a logistic regression model, and that model was tested with the testing group.  I also created another model by using an over sampler on the training data and retesting it.
